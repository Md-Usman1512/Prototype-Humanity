#Homelessness in Australia - Prototype design

Homelessness is not a choice, but rather a journey that many find themselves in (Asa Brown). 
Having a roof over your head is a basic necessity but there is no ‘home-like place’ for many with more than 116,000 people 
in Australia having to experience homelessness every night. Our mission is to fight the issue with various effective crisis response solutions.
